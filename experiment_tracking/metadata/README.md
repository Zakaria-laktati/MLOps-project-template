# Experiment Tracking Metadata

This directory contains metadata related to experiment tracking for the machine learning models developed in this project. 

## Purpose

The purpose of this metadata is to provide a structured way to log and retrieve information about various experiments conducted during the model development process. This includes details such as:

- Experiment parameters
- Model performance metrics
- Data versions used
- Experiment dates and timestamps

## Usage

To effectively utilize this metadata, ensure that all experiments are logged consistently. This can be achieved by integrating the logging process into your training scripts and pipelines.

## Structure

The metadata is organized in a way that allows for easy access and understanding. Each experiment should have its own entry, detailing the relevant information as specified above.

## Future Improvements

Consider implementing automated logging mechanisms to capture metadata during the training and evaluation phases. This will help maintain a comprehensive history of experiments and facilitate better decision-making based on past results.
